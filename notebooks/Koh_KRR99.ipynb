    "- Political economy: \"How does the macroeconomy how are policies affected?\"\n",
    "- Macroeconomics: \"How do policies affect the macroeconomy?\"\n",
    "- A serious discussion in each discipline eventually requires a dynamic model that answers the other discipline's questions (ex. \"Is this tax cut exogenous?\")\n",

    "Krusell and Rios-Rull 1999 (henceforth KRR): Dynamic macroeconomic model with political economic mechanism for determining income tax rate\n",
    "- Income tax rate is determined by votes of all agents in the economy, as in Meltzer and Richard (1981)\n",
    "\n",
    "Original goal of KRR, inspired from Meltzer and Richard (1981), is to predict the size of total transfers (to GDP ratio) and therefore the \"size of the U.S. government\" from political economy theory\n",
    "- \"The total size of transfers predicted by our political-economy model is quite close to the size of transfers in the data.\" [About 30\\% in the data and KRR's dynamic model]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, this strand of literature (ex. political business cycles) has focused on the political economy question rather than the macroeconomic question\n",
    "- Most of macroeconomics and its modelling until now has been homogeneous agents\n",
    "- But politics can't exist among homogeneous agents (especially with homogeneous preferences)\n",
    "- Macro deals in means, but political economy deals in medians\n",
    "\n",
    "With heterogeneous agent macro, now we can discuss models with different agents, with different levels of income/wealth and therefore different preferred levels of taxation (poor people want more taxation and more redistribution than rich people do)\n",

Economy is composed of heterogeneous consumers with individual labor productivity $\\varepsilon_{t}$ and assets $a_[t}$, receive at labor wage rate $w_{t}$ and capital rental rate $r_{t}$, pay $\\tau_{t}$ of their total income in tax, consume $c_{t}$ and save income towards individual wealth $a_{t+1}$\n",
