    "# A Life Cycle Model: Data and Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "National registry data on income and wealth from Scandinavian countries (esp. Norway) have recently become available (with a lot of security) to some (lucky!) researchers.   These data offer a uniquely powerful tool for testing (and improving) our models of consumption and saving behavior over the life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an example of how to construct a life cycle model with the HARK toolkit that makes predictions that can be compared to the raw data statistics that now are becoming available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, existing papers have tabulated information about the **growth rate** of assets at different ages over the life cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameters of the HARK life cycle model have not been optmized to match features of the Norwegian data; a first step in a real \"structural\" estimation would be to use Norwegian calibrate the inputs to the model (like the profile of income, and the magnitude of income shocks, over the life cycle), and then to find the values of parameters like the time preference rate that allow the model to fit the data best.  (See [SolvingMicroDSOPs](https://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs) for how this can be done, and search for the corresponding HARK content using [our documentation](https://hark.readthedocs.io))."

    "You can have luck in transitory income shocks or in permanent income shocks.  Their consequences are quite different.  With a permanent shock, you expect your (noncapital) income to change forever, and (according to Friedman (1957)) you should adjust your consumption nearly one-for-one.  With a transitory shock, you expect your income to return to its \"permanent\" level so you do not consume. So if you get a positive transitory shock, you will mostly save it.\n",

    "Specifically, they define \"active saving\" as the difference between income and consumption _neglecting_ any contriubutions from \"buy and hold\" assets like houses or stocks.  The \"active saving rate\" is the quantity of active saving divided by the level of income. They find that the \"active saving rate\" is remarkably stable over the range from roughly the 20th percentile to the 95th percentile of the wealth distribution.\n",

    "The basic model considered above does not allow for capital gains or losses, so it can be used to calculate directly the saving behavior of people who do not anticipate capital gains and losses.  So, the saving rate computed by the $\\texttt{savRte}$ function above should correspond to their \"active saving rate.\"\n",

    "Your problem is, for the entire population simulated above, to calculate what this predicts about the saving rate they measure.  You will do this by grouping the population into vigntile bins, and calculating the average active saving rate for all the households in each vigntile, and then plotting the wealth vigntiles against their saving rates.\n"

     "abstract": "In a model calibrated to match micro- and macroeconomic evidence on household income dynamics, we show that a modest degree of heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs is sufficient to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts that the aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is distributed across households (depending, e.g., on their wealth, or employment status).",

     "abstract": "We provide a systematic analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth using twenty years of population data from Norway’s administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, in a given cross-section, individuals earn markedly different returns on their assets, with a difference of 500 basis points between the 10th and the 90th percentile. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth. Fourth, returns have an individual permanent component that accounts for 60% of the explained variation. Fifth, for wealth below the 95th percentile, the individual permanent component accounts for the bulk of the correlation between returns and wealth; the correlation at the top reflects both compensation for risk and the correlation of wealth with the individual permanent component. Finally, the permanent component of the return to wealth is also (mildly) correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.",
