    "### The Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for this approach is pretty compelling:  Essentially, the consequence of permanent shocks is to make people get more and more different from each other continually over time as they accumulate permanent shocks.  So the degree to which the _changes_ in income keep increasing and increasing as time passes is a direct measure of the magnitude of the permanent shocks that are causing that divergence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If there were no permanent shocks, then in year $t$ and in year $t+d$ the person will have experienced transitory shocks $\\theta_{t}$ and $\\theta_{t+d}$.  But the very _definition_ of \"transitory\" means that none of the shocks in intervening periods has any consequence for the difference in incomes between $t$ and $t+d$.  Only the two transitory shocks of those two years contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Small Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data are measured at an annual frequency but income shocks can happen at any time during the year, then even if all shocks were permanent, an exercise like the one above, if conducted using annual data and using only three years of data (so, differences $\\Delta^{1}$ and $\\Delta^{2}$), would generate a biased answer due to the \"time aggregation\" problem ([Holbrook Working (1960)](doi:10.2307/1907574Copy); [Edmund Crawley (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2020.108998).  Briefly, imagine two people who are identical up to the beginning of year $t$.  And they both experience identically sized shocks to permanent income in period $t$ -- but one experiences the shock on January 1, and the other on October 1.  Thus, the first person's income is boosted for the entire year by the shock; for this person, the method above would work.  But for the second person, only (1/4) of the year was spent earning the permanently higher level of income.  They would show some increment of income for the year $t$, but then would spend all of year $t+1$ at the higher level of income.  So, there would be a small change in income in year $t$ followed by a (predictable) larger increase in year $t+1$ -- which _looks like_ serial correlation in income growth.  In particular, this problem would manifest itself in a spurious first-order moving average (MA) component in a time series estimation that allowed for such a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that the problem goes away if only spans of years 2 or more are used.  That is, we have no problem if we use $\\Delta^{3}$, $\\Delta^{4}$, etc.  Indeed, it can be shown that the magnitude of the permanent shock can be estimated even when there is a _true_ MA component to the transitory shock, simply by restricting the data used to those that span intervals long enough for the MA component to have disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Lower Bound on $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "The process above assumes that permanent income can wander to arbitrarily large or small values.  But in practice, all countries that are sophisticated enough to have household datasets of the kind needed to measure these shocks, also have some degree of social insurance that prevents income from falling below some \"necessity\" level of income.  It can be shown that, if measured income is bounded below (cannot fall too far), then the estimated magnitude of the permanent shocks will be biased down and estimates of the magnitude of the transitory shock will be biased up."
