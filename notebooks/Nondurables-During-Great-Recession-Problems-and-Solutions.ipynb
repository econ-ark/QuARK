    "### ... and Uncertainty Could Induce A Drop In Consumption ...  \n",
    "Increased \"uncertainty\" has become a popular explanation of much of what happened in the Great Recession -- including this drop.  Qualitatively, it is well known that a perceived increase in labor income uncertainty should induce more saving (less consumption) for precautionary reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ... But Is the Story _Quantitatively_ Plausible?\n",
    "But if explaining a 4 percent drop in discretionary consumption would require an implausibly large increase in uncertainty, the story that uncertainty explains the consumption drop is implausible.  \n",

    "### Transitory Shocks, Permanent Shocks, or Unemployment\n",
    "The $\\texttt{ConsIndShockConsumerType}$ model incorporates three kinds of uncertainty: Unemployment spells, during which income is reduced to some small proportion of its normal level; and, for consumers who remain employed, transitory and permanent shocks with standard deviations $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ and $\\sigma_{\\psi}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question:\n",
    "How large an increase in the standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\psi}$ would be necessary to induce a 4 percent drop in consumption in one quarter?  What about $\\sigma_{\\theta}$?  How high would the perceived unemployment probability have to be?\n",

    "- \"Standard\" infinite horizon consumption/saving model, with mortality and permanent and temporary shocks to income\n",
    "- Ex-ante heterogeneity in consumers' discount factors\n",

    "With this basic setup, HARK's `IndShockConsumerType` is the appropriate subclass of $\\texttt{AgentType}$. So we need to prepare the parameters to create instances of that class.\n"

    "The figure shows that if people's beliefs about the standard deviation of permanent shocks to their incomes had changed from 0.06 (the default value) to about 0.012, the model would predict an immediate drop in consumption spending of about the magnitude seen in 2008.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is whether this is a reasonable or an unreasonable magnitude for a change in uncertainty.  Some perspective on that question is offered by the large literature that attempts to estimate the magnitude of persistent or permanent shocks to household income.  The answer varies substantially across household types, countries, and time periods, but our sense of the literature is that the whole span of the territory between 0.04 and ranging nearly up to 0.20 is well populated (in the sense that substantial populations of people or countries have been estimated to experience shocks of this magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion is that, in order for an increase in permanent income uncertainty to explain the entire drop in consumption spending, uncertainty in permanent income would have to have roughly doubled between Q2 and Q4 of 2008.  While this seems rather a large increase in uncertainty, it is by no means an absurdly large increase.  And, there is no reason to rule out the possibility that people perceived a likely change in the _level_ of their permanent income as well, which of course would translate one-for-one into a change in the appropriate level of consumption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that it is not at all implausible, as a quantitative proposition, that an increase in uncertainty could have been responsible for a substantial portion of the decline in nondurable expenditures in the Great Recesssion.  (And it is even easier for an increase in uncertainty to induce a decline in durable goods purchases."

    "### PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, many governments issued \"lockdown\" orders to their populations to deter the spread of the disease.  A consequence was that many industries that require in-person interaction (like restaurants) had no work for their employees.  A number of governments passed \"stimulus\" packages that included one-time cash payments to their citizens, as a crude way to get money to people who might otherwise have faced severe financial distress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the toolkit to perform an exercise designed to make a rough calculation of how such stimulus payments might affect the dynamics of aggregate consumption expenditures.  To do this, you will want to use the `ConsPrefShock` model, which allows for a temporary shock to the utility from consumption that can be used to model a one-quarter closing of restaurants and other retail businesses (your marginal utility of spending money on restaurants goes to zero if the restaurants are closed!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, you might incorporate a negative marginal utility shock of 10 percent in the quarter when the pandemic recession hits, followed by a full bounceback of marginal utility to its normal state one quarter later.  And, I suggest you incorporate a stimulus payment of about 5 percent of annual income for a typical consumer.  Your task is to show the path of consumer spending leading up to the pandemic quarter (which should be flat, since the pandemic is unanticipated), and then the path during the pandemic quarter and in the several quarters after it."
